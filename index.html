<p>The  green map is the visualization made by the noise complaint in NYC last year and the orange map is the visualization made by mental health service clinics in NYC.</p>
  <p> Through data visualization, I notice the the area happened most noise complaints filed are overlapping with areas more concentrated with mental health service clinics.</p>
   <p> From my former project with Arduino，I find out that noise is related to people's stress and mood, which can cause mental health problems.</p>

   <p> I dicover most areas that have mental health patients, also have many compliants by noise. Such as Chelsea， East Village(Alphabet City), West Village(Washington Square Village)
    but some place like Chinatown, also have many mental health patients but have less noise compliant, which means the mental health problem may related to other reasons.</p>
   <p>
    Through this overlap, I want to show how noise give the stressful mood to NYC residents.</p>
